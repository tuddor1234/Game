# Greenfoot Game with funny duck

This is an old game I created in 2016 in a game engine called Greenfoot. It was a pretty limited 2D experience, but I really had fun working on it.  Here are a few screenshots from the game.

If you want to run it, make sure you have ![greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/download) and java installed.
